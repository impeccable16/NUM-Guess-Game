# NUM-Guess-Game
<br>
This is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number within a given range.
<br>
You will be prompted to enter a lower and upper bound for the range of numbers that the computer can choose from. Once you have entered the bounds, the computer will choose a random number within that range and you will be given a certain number of chances to guess the correct number.

If you guess the correct number within the given number of chances, you will win the game. If you run out of chances, the game will end and you will be shown the correct number.
<br>
This program requires the following Python modules:<br>
<li>random</li>
<li>math</li>
